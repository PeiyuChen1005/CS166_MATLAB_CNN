# CNN Classification MATLAB

This is an example of using MATLAB toolbox to quickly build convolutional neural network.

Please refer to these two files in this repository:

* *Chinese Ver:*`CNN.mlx` 
* *English Ver:*`CNN_en.mlx`

This example includes how to preprocess the data, how to use the deep learning toolbox of MATLAB to build and visualize the neural network, and how to output the characteristics of a certain layer of the neural network.
